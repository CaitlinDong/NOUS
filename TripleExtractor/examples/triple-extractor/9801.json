The experiment formed a part of a wider airborne campaign involving three aircraft based in Guam, to characterise the atmospheric composition above the tropical West Pacic in unprecedented detail. Thirty-nine ozonesondes were launched between 2 and 25 February of which 34 gave good ozone proles. Particular attention was paid to evaluating the background current of the ozonesondes, as this can amount to half the measured signal in the tropical tropopause layer surements and required a departure from standard operating procedures for the ozonesondes. The most signicant departure was not exposing the sondes to ozone during preparation, which meant that the background current remained stable before launch. Comparison with aircraft measurements allows validation of the measured ozone proles and conthroughout the prole, equal to the minimum value measured during preparation just before launch. From this set of 34 ozonesondes, the minimum reproducible ozone concentration measured in the TTL was 1213 ppbv; no examples of ozone concentrations < 5 ppbv, as reported by other recent papers, were measured. The lowest ozone concentrations coincided with outow from extensive deep convection to the east of Manus, consistent with uplift of ozone-poor air from the boundary layer. However, these minima were lower than the ozone concentration measured through most of the boundary layer, and were matched only by measurements at the surface in Manus"

                    "Introduction_0": "The Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL) is the region of the tropical atmosphere between the top of the main convective outow and the base of the stratosphere (approximately 13 17 km altitude) (Holton et al., 1995; Highwood and Hoskins, 1998; Folkins et al., 1999; Gettelman and Forster, 2002; Fueglistaler et al., 2009; Ploeger et al. It is a transition layer between the convectively dominated mid-troposphere beneath and the statically stable (and convection-free) stratosphere above, with composition dependent both on convective uplift and large-scale transport. Since the TTL is the main source region for air entering the stratosphere in the BrewerDobson circulation, the concentrations of source gases within it determine the stratospheric burden of ozone-destroying radicals such as Clx and Brx. Furthermore, the temperature of the cold point determines the concentration of water vapour in the stratosphere, while clouds in the TTL, especially near the cold point, affect the radiation budget. The TTL is therefore a region of considerable importance both for global stratospheric chemistry and for climate. The region of the tropics from the Maritime Continent to the International Date Line is known as the Tropical Warm Pool, where very warm sea surface temperatures Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union. The tropopause is higher and colder here than in other regions of the tropics, especially in Northern Hemisphere winter, making this region of particular importance for the dehydration of air as it enters the stratosphere noted for very low ozone concentrations"

This pattern is not restricted to the stratomum in the same region, generally attributed to photochemical destruction of ozone in the very clean marine boundary layer followed by rapid vertical mixing by deep convection Folkins et al. (2002) noted that tropical ozone proles typically exhibit an S shape with height, with a minimum concentration in the boundary layer (where ozone is destroyed photochemically), a maximum in the mid-troposphere due to long-range transport, and a further minimum at around 11 km before increasing into the stratosphere. They argued that this is consistent with the effect of deep convection lifting air from the boundary layer to the outow region. Closer examination of this process however suggests a more complex explanation. (2009) analysed a series of ozonesondes launched from Darwin, Australia as part of the ACTIVE campaign (Vaughan et al., 2008) and concluded that the lowest TTL concentrations of ozone occurred above the level of convective outow. Back-trajectories suggested that the origin of this air lay to the north-east of Darwin, to the east and north-east of New Guinea. Uplift of air in large convective complexes over the warm ocean in this region was proposed as the source region for the lowest ozone concentrations measured over Darwin. This suggests that there may be preferred locations or hot spots for lifting material to the TTL"

                    "Introduction_2": " A controversial question regarding ozone measurements in the TTL is whether the concentrations can fall to nearzero values (< 10 ppbv) in the outow of deep convection. Ozonesonde observations during the CEPEX cruise over the central Pacic frequently measured ozone concentrations less than 10 ppbv, and occasionally close to zero in the TTL surface air (where ozone is often strongly depleted in the tropics) essentially unmodied to the outow of the convection could explain these observations, but they also pointed out that near-zero ozone in the TTL was encountered more frequently than near the surface during the cruise, and postulated that there may be a hitherto-unknown mechanism to destroy ozone in clouds. Model simulations by Lawrence et al. TTL over the West Pacic result from convective uplift, but could not replicate the very low ozone concentrations found by Kley et al. Such near-zero ozone values in ozonesonde proles were also reported by Solomon et al. (2005) and Rex et al. (2014), again in the West Pacic region. Doubts about the validity of these very low ozone concentrations were raised by Vmel and Diaz (2010), who examined in detail how the ozonesonde measurement is made. In particular they examined the background current  an interfering signal that must be allowed for when deriving ozone concentrations from the raw data.

We discuss the issue of the background current in detail in Sect. 2, but there is clearly uncertainty in the literature on the best way to account for it when calculating ozone proles from the raw ozonesonde data. One of the aims of this paper is to shed light on this uncertainty.

                    "Introduction_4": " The ground campaign took place at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) site next to the airport on Manus, and comprised an ozonesonde campaign with supporting ground-level observations from a TECO-49C UV photometric ozone monitor, a Picarro G-2401 cavity ring-down spectrometer to measure CO2, CH4 and CO, and a homebuilt gas chromatograph to measure halogenated compounds teorological data were provided by ARM and the Papua New Guinea Meteorological Service. The ground-based data set was collected between 1 and 25 February 2014, with 39 ozonesonde ascents (34 of which gave good data) between 2 and 25 February. As we show in this paper, overights of the NCAR Gulfstream V provided an opportunity to validate ozonesonde measurements in the TTL during conditions of low ozone concentration. A key result of the CONTRAST campaign, reported by Pan et al. (2015), is the bimodal distribution of free tropospheric ozone concentration measured over the tropical Western Pacic. Gulfstream V in situ measurements indicate that vertical mixing and uplift of near-surface air maintains a primary mode, narrowly distributed around 20 ppbv, from the surface to 15 km. A secondary mode below 10 km, broadly distributed around 60 ppbv, was identied as incursions of creases the measured signal and which must be accounted for when calculating the ozone concentration. The background current is of particular importance in the TTL where it can be a substantial fraction of the total current measured by the sonde. The best way to correct for the background current is the subject of much debate (e. Komhyr and Harris, 1971; Thornton and Niazy, 1982, 1983; Reid et al"

The practice of using a pressure-dependent correction arises from early suggestions that the ozonesonde reacts with oxygen (Komhyr and Harris, 1971), but later studies ruled out this mechanism and suggested that the background current should be taken as constant with altitude, at least in the troposphere (Thornton and Niazy, 1982; Reid et al. However, Johnson et al. (2002) found that a background reaction with the phosphate buffers of a standard electrolyte solution did lead to a time dependence. This confusion led Vmel and Diaz (2010) to examine in detail the issue of background current. In the normal preparation of an ozonesonde, the sonde is exposed to stratospheric concentrations of ozone to check that it is responding correctly. The background current is measured as the sonde is drawing in ozone-free air before and after exposure to ozone. (1996) recommended that the rst of these measurements be adopted as the background current and removed (as a constant value) from current measurements in ight. However the standard procedure for ozonesonde preparation (Smit et al"

Vmel and Diaz (2010) found that the background current continues to decrease after exposure to ozone, even for periods of hours  suggesting that a value measured 10 min after exposure to ozone will be an overestimate by the time a sonde reaches the TTL, leading to an underestimate of the ambient ozone concentration when subtracted from the measured current. This decrease in background current is strongly dependent on the strength of the phosphate buffer concentration in the cell solution. Vmel and Diaz (2010) recommended the use of a background current Ibg = 0.014 A for the 1 % KI, full-buffer cathode cell solutions used in this paper, regardless of the measurements made during sonde preparation; the dependence of Ibg on the current I suggesting that the assumption of two electrons per ozone molecule passing through the cathode cell is not correct. Reprocessing past soundings with this formula for background current was shown to remove all the cases of near-zero ozone  not surprising as the background current of  0.025 A that this gives in the TTL is well below the 0.065 A used for example in the original analysis of the CEPEX data. Independent verication of Vmel and Diaz (2010) has however not been performed to date, and we midlatitude air based on the low humidity and layered structure. The minimum ozone concentration measured during CONTRAST between 12 and 15 km was 13 ppbv, consistent with Vmel and Diaz (2010)s contention that ozonesonde measurements of much lower concentrations are not reliable"

The current produced is proportional to the ow of ozone through the cathode cell, with each ozone molecule assumed to generate two electrons (Komhyr, 1969). However, this is not the only reaction that produces a current background current (Thornton and Niazy, 1982), which inexamine below the application of this recommendation to the Manus data set and the comparison with aircraft data. It is clear from previous work that the background current is not a well-dened quantity, and that there is uncertainty on the best way to measure it and its possible variation during ight. This is acknowledged by the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) report on ozonesondes (Smit et al., 2013) which calls for more fundamental research on this topic. We now describe in detail the ozonesonde preparation method in Manus, which departed from GAW-standard procedures in a number of ways.

Standard procedures for preparing ozonesondes follow a two-stage process aimed at reducing the background current to less than 50 nA at the time of launch and measuring the sondes pump ow rate. In this work the background current was obtained by drawing air into the sonde through a charcoal lter in an air-conditioned cabin where RH < 50 % picoammeter, and the pump ow rate F (in mL min1) with a Sensodyne Gilibrator unit. Repeated measurements of pump sure pO3 (in mPa) was derived from the measured sonde current as where Tbox was measured by taping a thermistor to the inlet tube as it entered the ozonesonde pump. In this equation I and Ibg are both measured in A and Tbox in K. A pump correction following Komhyr et al. (1995) was also applied to the data but this is negligible for the altitude range considered in this paper. The ozonesonde preparation procedures normally involve, at different stages, purging the electrochemical cell and/or the pump with high concentrations of ozone, characterising the cell response to expected atmospheric concentrations of ozone and drawing ozone-free air through the cell.

Standard ozonesonde procedures specify a change of solution once, at the beginning of the second preparation. We found in Manus, however, that repeated changes of solution were needed to reduce the background current to an acceptable value (the number of changes varied from sonde to sonde according to its requirements). The background current was measured both at the beginning of the second preparation and as the minimum value recorded by the Visl software after the sonde package was nally assembled (but before taking it out of the air-conditioned environment  in the humid tropical atmosphere outside the cabin the charcoal destruction lter does not work correctly). The procedures used in Manus departed, as already mentioned, from the GAW recommendations. The most important deviation (a consequence of the malfunctioning calibration unit, see below) was that the majority of sondes were not exposed to ozone during preparation. This turns out to have been advantageous, as it avoided the decay in Ibg reported by Vmel and Diaz (2010).

The effect of this is difcult to quantify, but will be most serious in a laboratory with humid air and measurable concentrations of ozone. In this case the relative humidity of cabin air was around 50 %, within the expected operational range of the lter.

A complication encountered during this experiment was the sudden appearance of a contamination source inside the TSC01 which produced a large signal from the ozonesonde.

The trajectories clearly indicate extensive uplift from the lower troposphere in the 48 h before the measurement, indicating that the source of the low ozone in the TTL is indeed the lower troposphere north of the Solomon Islands. Of course, the HYSPLIT trajectories cannot represent ascent in individual cloud systems, and so cannot determine whether the air is really of boundary-layer origin, but they do conrm that the meteorological conditions at this time were consistent with widespread deep uplifting of air"

Ozone concentrations < 15 ppbv extended up to 2 km in the dry period and persisted below 1 km up to 14 February, but in the very wet period the lowest values were in the range 1520 ppbv, more than the minima measured in the TTL. 14) tell a rather different story. The dry early period of the CAST campaign, from 1 to 12 February, was characterized by a strong diurnal variation in ozone, with maxima of  810 ppbv during the day and minima  2 3 ppbv at night. Winds were very light and variable, allowing the boundary layer to stabilise overnight, so we deduce that the night-time minima during this period were a local phenomenon. Wetter conditions set in by 13 February, with the diurnal ozone variation largely disappearing in the steady north-westerly breeze. Ozone concentrations in the range 9 13 ppbv predominated up to 19 February, with 1214 ppbv thereafter. These values are in fact consistent with the minimum values measured in the TTL (save for the very low value on 21 February)  and with the sondes, which generally measured a steep increase in ozone in the bottom 200 m of the prole (the altitude scale in Fig. 11 obscures this point). If the lower tropospheric ozone in the uplift region to the east of Manus was similar to that over the island, this would suggest that the air reaching the very top of the TTL in the wet period originated very near to the surface and was lifted to the tropopause without signicant mixing with surrounding air, consistent with the suggestion of Kley et al"

We were very fortunate that the Gulfstream V ight RF14 was able to y by Manus during the period when very low ozone concentrations were obwere free of contamination, and when using a constant background current measured just before launch their measurements agreed with the Gulfstream V to within 3 ppbv (the realistic limit on the accuracy of the ozonesonde at 100 mb is 5 ppbv due to background current uncertainty). We conclude that for a well-prepared sonde  i., (for the batch used here) one where Ibg  50 nA  a constant background current correction is the best choice. In preparing these sondes we found it necessary to change solutions in the cells up to three times during a day-of-ight preparation in order to ensure a sufciently low background current. Other than for sondes 3 and 4, we also did not expose the sondes to ozone during the day-of-ight preparation, which removes the problem of the slow decay in Ibg after such exposure (Vmel and Diaz, 2010). Both these changes in standard procedures are recommendations from this work. For the sondes exposed to contamination during rst preparation a hybrid background current correction was adopted after the laboratory investigation. Using this, the prole for sonde 6 was found to agree remarkably well with the aircraft prole from RF09 (Fig. 4), lending condence to this somewhat arbitrary correction"

The minimum reproducible ozone concentration measured in the TTL during CAST was 12 ppbv, consistent with the minimum of 13 ppbv measured between 12 and 15 km by the Gulfstream V during CONTRAST (Pan et al. This is also consistent with the minimum measured in Darwin with well-prepared sondes (12 and 11 ppbv on 23 January and 14 February 2006, respectively) in air whose origin, according to back-trajectory calculations, lay in deep convective uplift east and north-east of New Guinea. In both campaigns an isolated example of a lower concentration, around 89 ppbv, was also measured. The CAST measurements conmeasurements < 5 ppbv in the TTL are artifacts of the background current correction. The lowest ozone concentrations measured in the TTL above Manus occurred around 16 km during a period when widespread deep convection was occurring near and to the east of the island. This is consistent with the hot spot idea proposed by Heyes et al. (2009) for uplift of air to the upper TTL. The lowest ozone concentrations coincided with an easterly jet, consistent with outow from the deep convective complexes. At this time, the ozone concentration in the lowest 2 km over Manus exceeded 15 ppbv  only at the ground and in the bottom 200 m of the prole could values as low as 12 ppbv be found"

When the pattern found in Fig. 2 was discovered, the records of the CAST eld campaign were examined (Sect. A1) and a series of laboratory experiments devised to ascertain the reasons why the background current generally decreased between sondes 5 and 14 yet the minimum measured current in the TTL remained reasonably constant. It was observed that when an ozonesonde drew air from the TSC01 ozoniser unit, a high current was registered. This was identied in the laboratory experiments as being contamination, rather than high concentrations of ozone, as explained in Sect. Neither the source nor the identity of the contamination was known, and so an experiment was devised to determine the response of an ozonesonde to pressure with various degrees of contamination, by placing it into a bell jar and varying the pressure. The results of this experiment are described in Sect. The contamination gradually disappeared over time, so the bell jar experiments were neither reproducible nor did they replicate exactly the conditions that were experienced on Manus, but they serve as a check on the validity of the hybrid background current correction.

This affected the rst two ozonesondes day-of-ight preparations, and their background current remained well above that of a normal working ozonesonde. Thenceforth, an external ozone destruction air and the sonde was not exposed to the ozoniser during were briey exposed to the ozoniser during their rst preparation to check the response of the sonde to ozone. Since exposure to the ozoniser was resulting in elevated background currents, the ozonesonde sample tube was only connected to it for a few seconds before being removed. However, this turned out to be long enough to allow the contaminant to get into the ozonesonde where it remained throughout the preparations. Ozonesondes 15 onwards were not exposed to the ozoniser at all, and were therefore the most reliable ozonesondes launched during CAST. A2 Source of contamination In order to investigate the cause of the high background currents in the rst 14 ozonesondes, laboratory investigations were conducted after the equipment was returned from Manus to Manchester, some 2 months after the campaign ended. First, the response of an ozonesonde was compared with that of the TECO-49 ultraviolet photometric ozone and the ozonesonde measured comparable concentrations charcoal lter the sonde measured 2 ppbv while the TECO49 measured 12 ppbv. However, when sampling supposedly ozone-free air from the ozoniser (air drawn through an internal charcoal lter) the sonde measured 189 ppbv while the TECO-49 again measured 12 ppbv. Clearly, therefore, the ozoniser was acting as a source of some contaminant which produced a positive signal in the ozonesonde but not in the photometric ozone monitor  i"

                    "Conclusions_4": ", this substance was not ozone. (The 12 ppbv signal measured by the TECO through is much higher than the ozonesonde and exceeds the capacity of the lters). Further investigation, dismantling the ozoniser and examining different parts, identied the source of the contamination as the tube which is illuminated by a mercury lamp to generate ozone. However, contamination was found even on the PTFE manifold at the outlet of the ozoniser. A plausible explanation for the contamination, pointed out by one of the reviewers, is that condensation of water occurred inside the tube at some point, which, when irradiated by ultraviolet light, led to the production of hydrogen peroxide. H2O2 is known to react with KI in the cathode cell with a very slow response time (Cohen et al., 1967), consistent with the behaviour of the contaminant, and to stick to surfaces for a long time. The contaminant appeared rst thing in the morning when the equipment had been enclosed in the air-conditioned laboratory overnight. A3 Ozonesonde behaviour at different pressures The effect of lowering the ambient pressure on the contamination was then investigated by placing the ozonesonde in a bell jar and lowering the pressure as the sonde continually sampled the air inside the bell jar. The bell jar was too small to admit the ozone destruction lter but ozone measurements inside the jar at ambient pressure were the same as in the laboratory with the lter attached; thus air in the bell jar was ozone-free"

The ozonesonde was left for 5 min to settle and reach a constant background current, and then a new target pressure was chosen. The rst, heavily contaminated ozonesonde emulated the pared just after the contamination episode, but before the contamination was recognised. The slightly contaminated ozonesonde emulated ozonesondes 3 to 14, which were only contaminated on rst preparation. Ozonesondes 15 onwards were not contaminated, like the third test ozonesonde in this experiment. The heavily contaminated ozonesonde was contaminated on both rst preparation and the day-of-ight preparation and had a background current of 132 nA, which is comparable to the early ozonesondes in CAST.

This conrms that a reliable background current estimate could not be made for the rst two CAST sondes. The ozonesonde used in this experiment was subjected to a further preparation cycle (without exposure to contaminant) to investigate whether it could be cleaned. Its background current reached 40 nA after 15 min of no-ozone-air treatment, indicating that the contamination was changing its character remove the contamination. The second ozonesonde was initially contaminated in rst preparation, and then prepared cleanly in the day-of-ight preparation, similar to ozonesondes 314 in Manus. However, as with the rst test sonde, the contamination was found to disappear so that the day-of-ight background current was 55 nA  consistent with a clean ozonesonde. It appears than that the contaminant changed its nature and became less adhesive over the 3-month period since the contamination event. More contaminant was therefore added at the end of the second preparation, bringing the background current to 80 nA. The bell jar experiment showed little consistency in the background current as a function of pressure, but a clear decay over time (Fig. Since in a normal ozonesonde launch pressure decreases as a function of time, this gives weight to the idea that a decaying background current correction with pressure is appropriate for the slightly contaminated ozonesondes"

The experiment was split into two sections, one in which the ozonesonde remained above 200 hPa at all times, followed by another in which the pressure was pumped down to 70 hPa. The current decreased slightly between 1000 and 100 hPa similar to the result found by Thornton and Niazy (1983), which was attributed to a change in the mass transfer inside the ozonesonde. Within experimental accuracy of 10 nA, therefore, a constant background current is appropriate to the uncontaminated ozonesondes up to 100 hPa, with a possible decrease above this level. As the tropopause pressure encountered in Manus was > 90 hPa, with the ozone concentration increasing rapidly into the stratosphere, we have used a constant background current throughout the prole for unA4 Conclusions from laboratory experimentation The laboratory experiments could not reproduce the exact conditions experienced in Manus because the contamination was gradually disappearing and becoming less adhesive over time. This is consistent with the general decrease of background current between sondes 5 and 14 in Manus, despite their identical preparation procedure. Nevertheless, the behaviour is sufciently similar to the CAST sondes as to provide support for the method used in Eq. (5) to calculate the background current. The bell-jar experiments show that the background current in this batch of ozonesondes was largely constant in the absence of contamination, while that in a slightly contaminated ozonesonde reduced with time to a clean value over a period of  30 min"
