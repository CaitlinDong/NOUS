# NOUS : Incremental Maintenance of Knowledge Graphs
Data-driven applications critically depend on human experts,
who learn about the domain through their interaction with data
over time. NOUS presents a proposal knowledge bases that evolve over time. This
knowledge base will be useful for creating and validating
hypotheses and providing background knowledge for other analytical components.

## Introduction	
NOUS provides complete suite of capa- bilities needed to build a domain specific knowledge graph from streaming data. This includes natural language processing, entity and relationship mapping, rule learning and link prediction. Its search interface supports entity and path queries.

### Major Components of the NOUS are :

* Trusted Source Selection
* Streaming Data Extraction & Fusion
* Pattern Mining
* Link Predication
* Query Question-Answering
