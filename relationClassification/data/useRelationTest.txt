The <e1>effects of subgrid cloud variability</e1> on grid-average microphysical rates and radiative fluxes are examined by use of <e2>long-term retrieval products</e2> at the Tropical West Pacific, Southern Great Plains, and North Slope of Alaska sites of the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program.

Four commonly used <e1>distribution functions</e1>, the truncated Gaussian, Gamma, lognormal, and Weibull distributions, are constrained to have the same mean and standard deviation as <e2>observed cloud liquid water content</e2>. (e1,e2)

To assess the applicability of <e1>2DC data</e1> obtained without anti-shatter tips previously used in <e2>parameterization schemes</e2> for numerical models and remote sensing retrievals, the impacts of artifacts on bulk microphysical and scattering properties were examined by quantifying differences between such properties derived from 2DCs with standard and anti-shatter tips, and with and without the use of shatter detection algorithms using the ISDAC and IDEAS-2011data.
