##src  
Python scripts for information collection are in `src` directory. You need python2.7 or above to run them. Also, you need install `xmltodict` package to parse the xml file grabbed from source website.

To install `xmltodict`, run  
`pip install xmltodict`  

To collect and parse instrument information at [ARM](http://www.arm.gov) website run  
 `python getInfo.py`  
 It will generate `data.json` which contains the basic knowledge of instruments.  
 
To collect and parse AAF instruments information at [ARM](http://www.arm.gov) website run  
 `python getAAF.py`  
 It will generate `aafdata.json` which contains the basic knowledge of instruments.  
 
 To generate knowledge graph, take `data.json` and 'aafdata.json' as input, run  
 `python genTriple.py`  
 It will generate `triples.txt` as the knowledge base.  
 
 To generate results after disambiguation, run  
 `python parseTitleAbs.py <your_text_file_after_disambiguation>`  
 It outputs `parsedAbs.csv` to display the results. In our case, we use `text_info/Test13-16.txt` as the input. For details to obtain this input, see [NOUS](https://github.com/streaming-graphs/NOUS)  


##text_info  
Generated text information are in `text_info` directory. They are  

`titleAbs.txt` : 540 paper titles and abstracts are listed in this file. 

`pureAbs.txt` : 540 paper abstracts only.  

`data.json` : raw data parsed from xml file generated by solr search.

`triples.txt` : Instrument knowledge extracted from ARM website. It contains information like `<Site> <hasInstrument> <Instrument>`  

`AAF_instrument.txt` : AAF instruments name list

`aafdata.json` : raw data about AAF instrument parsed from xml file generated by solr search.

`triplesAAF.txt` : Portable instruments knowledge extracted from ARM website. It contains information like `<Site> <hasInstrument> <Instrument>`  

`T2015.json` : Results after disambiguation by knowledge base.  

`parsedAbs.csv` : disambiguation results for each paper from 2013 to 2016. (Ordered by year)
